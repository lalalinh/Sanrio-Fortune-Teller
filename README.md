# Sanrio-Fortune-Teller

Themed by Japanese fairy-animation style, accompanied by Sanrio characters, the Little Twin Stars to be a coupled fortune teller of users’ destined reminder of the day. Developed with Python Tkinter (GUI – Graphic User Interface library) and Pillow (Imaging library).

- Background image and the twins gif files should be incorporated and called under one folder with the code file.
